# Datasets

Instead of creating an interface to load collections, qrels, etc. of data sets, we have followed/extended on the
structure used in the python package ```ir_datasets```.

IR datasets provides a small amount or data sets. In ConverSE, we expand the data sets with the data sets that can be
found in the file: ```converse_datasets.yaml```
