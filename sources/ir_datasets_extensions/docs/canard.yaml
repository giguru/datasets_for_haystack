    CANARD is a dataset for question-in-context rewriting that consists of questions each given in a dialog context
    together with a context-independent rewriting of the question. The context of each question is the dialog utterences
    that precede the question. CANARD can be used to evaluate question rewriting models that handle important linguistic
    phenomena such as coreference and ellipsis resolution.
    CANARD is based on QuAC (Choi et al., 2018)---a conversational reading comprehension dataset in which answers are
    selected spans from a given section in a Wikipedia article.
